# Data_Journalisms_And_D3
In this project i wish to find out the series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. The first story idea is sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml]

To accomplished this ; Created a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.

Used the D3 techniques created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.

Included state abbreviations in the circles.

Created and situated axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

Used python -m http.server to run the visualization.
